# Hey there! 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I’m **Colin Kirby**, a recent **Computer Engineering** grad from UCF who loves building at the intersection of **software, finance, and data**. I’m hands-on, product-minded, and persistent about learning—aiming to grow inside great engineering orgs while exploring ideas that could become real businesses.

## 🧱 What I’m building now
- **Centi** — a modern personal-finance app that connects bank accounts (Plaid), supports CSV imports, and turns activity into clear insights and a simple **Centi Score**.  
  _Stack:_ React · FastAPI · PostgreSQL · OAuth
- **My Portfolio Website** — an interactive showcase of projects plus a small CSS/UI cheat sheet for fast, consistent design.  
  _Stack:_ React · Tailwind · Vite

## ✅ Selected projects (previous work)
- **SentimentTrader** — pure-Python pipeline that pulls Reddit chatter, runs sentiment, and generates next-day stock-movement signals.  
  _Write-ups & docs on my LinkedIn Projects page._
- **SecureScape** — portable, offline perimeter security with on-device person detection (ESP32-CAM) and a Flutter app for alerts.  
  _Code:_ [Core System](https://github.com/TopelJL/Deployable-Security-Sytem) · [Mobile App](https://github.com/KirbysGit/dssApp) · [Website](https://github.com/KirbysGit/dssWebsite)
- **ShelfVision** — dense retail-shelf object detection with a custom PyTorch pipeline (ResNet-50 + FPN) and OpenCV tooling.  
  _Code:_ [I2DLproj](https://github.com/KirbysGit/I2DLproj)

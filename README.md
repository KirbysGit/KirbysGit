welcome to my **git** , i'm **colin kirby**, a recent CpE grad from UCF. i really love creating, and i use github as a tool to store my software / machine learning projects.

i try to keep them organized but looking through you'll see its sometimes a struggle. right now i'm really focusing on one thing :

- **sentitrader** - etl pipeline for parsing reddit sentiment and generating stock signals (i'm trying to not miss out on the next GME 😭)

but i have a couple of others that i'm planning on moving forth with later :

- **taylor.io** - resume tailoring site where users store a dict of info to generate tailored resumes based on job descriptions
- **centi.dev** - personal finance manager for tracking spending (you can check it out thus far -> <u>https://centi.dev</u>)

## outside of work
i love self-growth!! just trying to be better day after day. i do this through : 

- **music** -> i currently just play guitar and piano, practice just about everyday, would love to get into production too!
- **being active** -> getting stronger in the gym, trying new sports like tennis, golf, skating, or just sticking to my oldies like basketball, football, volleyball
- **learning** -> new languages (right now spanish is the focus),  studying and practicing music theory, practicing my leetcode for interviews 
- **art** -> whether its just doodling, design ui mockups, or drawing stupid memes on my roommate's whiteboard i just love creative expression
- **mindset** -> self-improvement podcasts and books, current favorite podcasts are chris williamson, mark manson, andrew huberman, but there's so many

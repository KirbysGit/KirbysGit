# Hey!! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="26" height="26" />

## 🔎 Lil About Me
I’m **Colin Kirby**, a recent **Computer Engineering** grad from UCF who loves building projects and tinkering with design. Right now I’m learning by doing and looking for full-stack software roles so I can keep shipping things that are actually useful.

## 🛠️ What I’m building
- **My Portfolio Website** - A space to show my background and projects so recruiters get more than a plain white PDF.
- **SentimentTrader** - A social sentiment project that reads platforms like Reddit to surface tickers and patterns for investing experiments.

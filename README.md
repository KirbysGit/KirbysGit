## 🔎 Lil About Me
I’m **Colin Kirby**, a recent **Computer Engineering** grad from UCF who loves building projects and messing with design. Right now I’m learning by doing and looking for software roles around full-stack so I can keep shipping things that are actually useful.

## 🛠️ What I’m building
- **My Portfolio Website** — cool showcase of my background, wanted to be able to show recruiters who I am without a boring white piece of paper.
- **SentimentTrader** - this is one of my favorite projects, but it needs a lot of work, basically, reads social media, helps me invest.
